# Data-Managment-Plan
A plan to start to get all of my data into a safe backup system. 

1. Data backup will be automated to an offsite storage system. Program to do this will be saved and updated in this github repo. A NAS on my remote home network is a good potential target.
2. Data will also have a local backup as a defense against file save problems or if I need to roll back.
3. Portable HDDs are a bad method and have no built in redundancy. This is something to work on.
